<h1> The Climate Consortium</h1>
<h2>  </h2>

<p> <img src="Profile_pics.jpeg" width="600" height="450"> </p>

<p> The Climate Consortium started as an exploratory project between friends-turned-collabortors across academia, national laboratories, and industry. </p>

<p> I have a PhD from the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Oklahoma State University and my research deals with the use of data-driven techniques for the model order reduction of computationally expensive problems. Most of my work has revolved around the use of artificial neural networks formulated for corrections to truncated systems being evolved by transformed governing laws.</p>

<p> My graduate adviser was Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=MrS0c8MAAAAJ">Omer San</a>, PI at the <a href="http://www.cfdlab.org">Computational Fluid Dynamics Laboratory</a> where we endeavored to investigate elegant combinations of machine learning algorithms and physics based models for the computational sciences.

<!-- <h2>Gauss</h2>
<p>I decided to name my cat Gauss, after picking him up from the shelter due to his intense curiosity about everything around him. He loves sniffing around and contemplating his surroundings, much like his medieval counterpart did with mathematics and the natural sciences. He's a smart guy isn't he?</p> -->
